Problem 1
---------

Read and clean the data, retain line, station name, station latitude/longitude, routes served, entry, vending, entrance type, and ADA compliance. Convert entry variable to logical from character.

``` r
subway_data = read_csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, route1, route2, route3, route4, route5, route6, route7, route8, route9, route10, route11, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>%
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, "YES" = TRUE, "NO" = FALSE)) %>%
  gather(key = route_served, value = route, route1:route11)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_character(),
    ##   `Station Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Station Longitude` = col_double(),
    ##   Route8 = col_integer(),
    ##   Route9 = col_integer(),
    ##   Route10 = col_integer(),
    ##   Route11 = col_integer(),
    ##   ADA = col_logical(),
    ##   `Free Crossover` = col_logical(),
    ##   `Entrance Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Entrance Longitude` = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

Describe the dataset:

This dataset contains information on the NYC subway. Each observation has a station name, the line it's on, the latitude and longitude of the station, the route(s) it serves, if you can enter the station, if there is vending, what type of entrance the station has, and if it is ADA compliant. There is a maximum of 11 routes served for each station. The dataset has 20548 rows and 10 columns. These data could be more tidy by further cleaning the route\_served variable.

``` r
subway_data = distinct(subway_data, station_name, route, .keep_all = TRUE)
subway_no_vending = filter(subway_data, vending == "NO")
```

There are 1241 distinct stations. 295 stations are ADA compliant. The proportion of station entrances/exits without vending that allow entrance is 0.6363636.

Problem 2
---------

``` r
mr_trash_wheel_data = read_excel("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2017-9-26.xlsx", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", range = cell_cols("A2:N258")) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(-x_1) %>%
  filter(!is.na(dumpster), !is.na(date)) %>%
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls))
```
