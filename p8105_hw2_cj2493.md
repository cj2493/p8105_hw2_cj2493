Problem 1
---------

Read and clean the data, retain line, station name, station latitude/longitude, routes served, entry, vending, entrance type, and ADA compliance. Convert entry variable to logical from character.

``` r
subway_data = read_csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, route1, route2, route3, route4, route5, route6, route7, route8, route9, route10, route11, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>%
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, "YES" = TRUE, "NO" = FALSE)) 
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_character(),
    ##   `Station Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Station Longitude` = col_double(),
    ##   Route8 = col_integer(),
    ##   Route9 = col_integer(),
    ##   Route10 = col_integer(),
    ##   Route11 = col_integer(),
    ##   ADA = col_logical(),
    ##   `Free Crossover` = col_logical(),
    ##   `Entrance Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Entrance Longitude` = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

Describe the dataset:

This dataset contains information on the NYC subway. Each observation has a station name, the line it's on, the latitude and longitude of the station, the route(s) it serves, if you can enter the station, if there is vending, what type of entrance the station has, and if it is ADA compliant. There is a maximum of 11 routes served for each station. The dataset has 1868 rows and 19 columns. These data could be more tidy by combining the routes served into one variable.
