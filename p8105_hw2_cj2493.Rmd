## Problem 1

Read and clean the data, retain line, station name, station latitude/longitude, routes served, entry, vending, entrance type, and ADA compliance. Convert entry variable to logical from character.

```{r, clean}
subway_data = read_csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, route1, route2, route3, route4, route5, route6, route7, route8, route9, route10, route11, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>%
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, "YES" = TRUE, "NO" = FALSE))
```
